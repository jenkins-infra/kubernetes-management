# Jenkins Infrastructure Helm Charts

This repository defines and stores helm charts used by jenkins infrastructure project to configure its clusters.

It combines a Jenkinsfile, helmfiles and helm charts to automate Kubernetes Cluster configuration.

## Issues

Any issues can be reported on our [ticket system](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/projects/INFRA/)

## Repository Structure

This project contains the following main directories:

* `clusters`: This folder contains the per-cluster [helmfiles](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) with the releases to apply per cluster
* `config`: This folder contains the specific configuration for our environments

## Secrets

Secrets are encrypted with [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) and a default configuration is defined in `.sops.yaml`
Currently there are two kinds of encryption keys: a GPG key and an Azure Key-Vault (accessible from Kubernetes clusters).

All secrets are expected to be found in the `./secrets` folder which is absent (gitignored) by default.

If you can access the secrets, you have to set up the local `./secrets` folder from the (private) repository [jenkins-infra/charts-secrets](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/charts-secrets.git) with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jenkins-infra/charts-secrets.git ./secrets
```

Then, you can edit a secret by using the `sops ./secrets/.../<your yaml file>` command.

## Docker

This folder defines a custom Dockerfile in order to build a custom image to orchestrate our clusters

## Remarks

* We need one jenkins instance per cluster so we should split cluster orchestration tasks outside release.ci.jenkins.io

* If RBAC is enabled on the cluster, before being able to use helm, we need to create a service acccount for helm with the right cluster role binding.
we can run following command: ```kubectl apply -f helm/rbac.yaml```

## Minikube

```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.15.11
minikube addons enable ingress
helm install stable/nginx-ingress nginx-ingress, we can't install the ingress defined in this repository for testing servers
kubectl -n release port-forward default-release-jenkins-77fd54976f-ns2c6 8081:8080

kubectl get secrets -n release  default-release-jenkins -o json
```
