# Contributing Guidelines

The Jenkins Infrastructure Charts project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Sign Your Work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for a commit. All commits needs to be signed. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the material.

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>

If you set your user.name and user.email git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with git commit -s.

Note: If your git config information is set properly then viewing the git log information for your commit will look something like this:

Author: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 2 11:41:15 2018 -0800

    Update README

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>

## Support Channels

Whether you are a user or contributor, you can contact us through the [chat channels](https://www.jenkins.io/chat/#jenkins-infra) or through the [community forum](https://community.jenkins.io/).

Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.
